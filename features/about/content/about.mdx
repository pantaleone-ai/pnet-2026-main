  ## Introduction
  I am a Frontend Developer with more than 5 years of experience building modern web applications with Next.js, TailwindCSS, and TypeScript.
  
  I currently live in the San Francisco Bay Area with my family. I am originally from Mongolia and studied Computer Science in Germany. I speak English, German, and Mongolian, and I also understand some Russian.

  ## How I got started
 In 2011, I bought an Android development book and started learning Android using my existing knowledge of Java and Eclipse. During my student years, I built small projects with Eclipse, Java, and XML. While learning Android development, I built and launched two Android apps on the Google Play Store. One was a local marketplace app, and the other was a custom T shirt design app featuring Mongolian designers. Those early projects became the foundation for everything I have built since.

  ## Android Development
  After launching my first two apps in 2011, I took a long break. In 2018, I returned to Android development and started learning Kotlin, Jetpack components, and modern Android tools. I published two more apps, and one of them was featured on a well known Android YouTuber’s channel <Link href="https://youtu.be/OHo64fiWx2k?si=uJG6tzMkM80Nu94P&t=810">here</Link>. That recognition gave me a big boost.

  ## Web Development
  Great mobile apps need strong backends and clean landing pages, so I explored Next.js, React, and TailwindCSS. I quickly fell in love with Next.js and TailwindCSS for their simplicity. I built two full stack Next.js apps that earned more than 460 GitHub stars and received official recognition for my open source contribution in the form of <Link href="https://x.com/hiretimsf/status/1799500139662651526">Vercel Swag</Link> from former CTO <Link href="https://x.com/leerob">Lee Robinson</Link>.

  ## Today
  My focus has shifted to Next.js and Tailwind CSS, where I am significantly more productive. The workflow is fun and flexible, enabling me to ship fast, test ideas quickly, and reach users instantly. I am continuously improving my skills through personal projects.
