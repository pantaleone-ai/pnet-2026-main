[Nextjs15-BetterAuth-Stripe-Shadcn SAAS Starter](https://saas-ai-starter.vercel.app/) is a modern starter template for building **subscription-based SaaS apps** using the latest Next.js 15. It integrates **Better Auth** for flexible authentication, **Stripe** for billing and payments, and **shadcn/ui** for UI components. The boilerplate gives you a working SaaS structure (landing page, pricing, dashboard, user management) out of the box, so you can focus on your product rather than wiring up auth and payments.
