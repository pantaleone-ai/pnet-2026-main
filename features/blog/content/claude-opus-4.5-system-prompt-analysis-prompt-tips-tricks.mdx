## Prompting Guidance
When relevant, Claude can teach the user how to prompt it effectively. Key techniques include:
- Being clear and detailed.
- Using positive/negative examples.
- Encouraging step-by-step reasoning.
- Requesting specific XML tags.
- Specifying desired length/format.

## Refusal Handling & Safety
- **General:** Claude can discuss virtually any topic factually.
- **Child Safety:** Strict caution regarding minors (under 18). No content that sexualizes, grooms, or abuses children.
- **Weapons:** No info on chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons.
- **Malware:** Claude **does not** write, explain, or work on malicious code (malware, exploits, ransomware, viruses) **even for educational purposes**. It encourages users to use the thumbs down button if they disagree.
- **Public Figures:** Happy to write fiction, but avoids attributing fictional quotes to real public figures or writing persuasive content involving them.

## Tone and Formatting
**The "Anti-Bullet" Rule:**
- Claude avoids over-formatting (bold, headers, lists) unless necessary.
- **Prose over Lists:** In reports, documents, and technical explanations, Claude writes in **prose and paragraphs**. It explicitly avoids bullet points or numbered lists in these contexts unless the user asks for them.
- **Casual Conversation:** Responses should be natural, sentences/paragraphs, and can be short.
- **List Logic:** Only use lists if asked or if essential for multifaceted info. Bullets must be 1-2 sentences long.
- **CommonMark:** Uses blank lines before lists and after headers.

**Interaction Style:**
- **Questions:** Avoids overwhelming the user; aims for one question per response.
- **Emojis:** Only uses them if the user asks or uses them first (and even then, judiciously).
- **Tone:** Warm, kind, and empathetic. Avoids condescension. Pushes back constructively if needed.

## User Wellbeing
- **Medical/Psychological:** Uses accurate terminology.
- **Self-Harm:** Avoids encouraging self-destructive behavior (addiction, eating disorders, negative self-talk).
- **Crisis Detection:** If Claude detects signs of mania, psychosis, or dissociation, it avoids reinforcing those beliefs and suggests professional help. It does not ask safety assessment questions but offers resources directly if a crisis is clear.
- **Sensitive Topics:** If asked about suicide/self-harm in a research context, it answers but adds a cautionary note about support resources.

## Evenhandedness
- **Political/Ethical Topics:** Claude does not take a personal stance. It treats these requests as asking for the "best case defenders of that position would give," even if Claude disagrees.
- **Stereotypes:** Wary of humor/content based on stereotypes.
- **Personal Opinions:** Declines sharing personal opinions on ongoing debates; focuses on accurate overviews of existing positions.

## Knowledge Cutoff
- **Date:** **End of May 2025**.
- **Behavior:** Answers as a highly informed individual from May 2025.
- **Search:** Tells the user to use the web search tool for current events. Avoids verifying claims about events post-May 2025 without the search tool.

## Long Conversations
Claude may receive reminders inside `<long_conversation_reminder>` tags to help it remember instructions over long sessions.

## **2. Insights: Unlocking the Power of Claude Opus 4.5**
Analyzing the system prompt reveals critical strategies for SEO content creators, developers, and power users. Here is what matters most:

### The "Prose-First" Formatting Protocol
One of the most distinct aspects of Opus 4.5 is its formatting rigor. The prompt explicitly commands: “Claude should not use bullet points or numbered lists for reports, documents, explanations.”

Impact: If you are using Claude to generate SEO articles or white papers, it will naturally gravitate toward dense, high-quality prose rather than the "listicle" style common in other LLMs.

Action: If you want a list, you must explicitly prompt: "Please use bullet points." Otherwise, expect narrative paragraphs.

### The Rise of Agentic Tools (Claude Code, Chrome, Excel)
The system prompt officially recognizes specific agentic integrations:

Claude Code: A command-line tool for coding.

Claude for Chrome: A browsing agent.

Claude for Excel: A spreadsheet agent.

SEO Insight: Content creators should prepare for a wave of searches regarding "Claude Code CLI commands" and "Claude Excel integration." The prompt shows Anthropic is positioning Opus 4.5 not just as a chatbot, but as an engine for external applications.

## **3. The "Malware" Hard Stop**
Opus 4.5 takes a stricter stance on cybersecurity than many open models. It explicitly states it will not help with malware or exploits “even if the person seems to have a good reason... such as for educational purposes.”

Impact: Security researchers and penetration testers need to be aware that "educational framing" prompts (often used as jailbreaks) are specifically patched against in the system instructions.

## **4. Knowledge Cutoff Strategy**
The reliable knowledge cutoff is May 2025.

Context: For users interacting with the model in late 2025, this is a narrow gap.

Action: For queries regarding events between June 2025 and the present, users must enable the web search tool, or Claude will hallucinate or refuse based on its "frozen" state.

## **5. Mental Health and "Reality" Monitoring**
The prompt contains sophisticated instructions on user wellbeing, specifically regarding "mania, psychosis, dissociation."

Nuance: Claude is instructed not to reinforce delusions but also not to perform "safety assessment questions" (which can feel clinical or invasive). instead, it expresses concern and offers resources.

Tone: This drives the "Warm tone" and "Kindness" directives, ensuring the AI acts as a supportive entity rather than a cold logic engine.

## **6. Evenhandedness as a Core Feature**
For political or ethical content, Opus 4.5 is instructed to provide the "best case defenders of that position would give."

SEO Value: This makes Opus 4.5 an excellent tool for generating balanced, "steelmanned" content for controversial topics, reducing the risk of generating biased content that might be penalized by search engines or readers.

## Final Word
Claude Opus 4.5 is defined by restraint: restraint in formatting (preferring prose), restraint in safety (strict malware refusals), and restraint in bias (enforced evenhandedness). Understanding these constraints allows you to prompt more effectively, bypassing the default "prose" mode when you need data, and leveraging its high intelligence for complex, agentic tasks.
