# Introduction - Why LLMs.txt
For decades, we built websites for two audiences: humans and search engine crawlers (Google). We used HTML/CSS for the humans and sitemap.xml or robots.txt for the crawlers.

But there is a third audience now: **AI Agents.**

LLMs (Large Language Models) like Claude, ChatGPT, and Groq are browsing the web to answer user questions. When they visit your site, they don't care about your animations, your sticky headers, or your marketing fluff. They want raw, dense context.

If you don't provide it, they hallucinate. They guess. Or worse, they ignore you.

An llms.txt file is the solution. It is a markdown file that acts as a "Read Me" for AI, explaining exactly what your site is, what it does, and how to navigate it.

# Why You Need It Now
- **Control the Narrative:** Don't let an LLM guess what your business does based on messy HTML. Tell it explicitly.
- **Agentic Ready:** If you have tools (like stock screeners or calculators), an llms.txt file tells agents *how* to use them. This turns your site from a passive brochure into an active tool.
- **Zero Ambiguity:** Standard web scraping is messy. Markdown is clean. By providing this file, you ensure your data is ingested 100% correctly.
- **Future-Proofing:** As search shifts from "10 blue links" to "AI answers," having this file is the SEO of the future.

# The Methodology: Anatomy of a Perfect llms.txt
The goal is **scannability**. We use Markdown because it is the native language of LLMs.

We recently generated the llms.txt for **Pantaleone.net**. Here is the breakdown of why we structured it this way:

- **The Hook:** A blockquote > with the concise value proposition.
- **The Map:** A clear list of routes.
- **The Capabilities:** Explicit definitions of tools (like "ProfitSignals") so the AI knows they exist.
