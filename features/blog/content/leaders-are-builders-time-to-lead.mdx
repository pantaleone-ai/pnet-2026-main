## CFO's and security leaders in your organization are worried...  They see hundreds of new tools, millions of "tokens" being generated per second, bills associated to token generation costs.  And in most organizations, its out of control.

### Its time to get this under control and to think about pausing new AI related purchases.

Often its the wrong question being considered. It's not "what tool should we get?" or "how will Vendor X support us?" It's "what foundation must we build to become a complete AI organization?"

While most bolt on toys and look for the next shiny object, the real leaders are building their own proprietary AI platforms - infusing data and context at scale. They are rewiring their businesses from the ground up.

They know the revolution is built and infused with proprietary context, not purchased off the shelf.
