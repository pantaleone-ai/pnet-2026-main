# Introduction

Auth setup is a necessary evil. Most official documentation is a maze designed to waste a builder's time. This isn't that.

This is a direct, unfiltered guide. No fluff, no broken premises. Just the critical steps to get your **OAuth 2.0 credentials** for the major platforms and move on. Don't just patch on a login system; build a solid foundation for user access. Let's get it done.

## 1. Google OAuth (6 Steps)

The baseline. Get this done first.
**Dashboard:** `https://console.developers.google.com/`

1.  **New Project:** Go to Google Cloud Console. Name it `ImgSquash [Environment]`. Create it.
2.  **Enable API:** Navigate to `APIs & Services` → `Library`. Search for `Google+ API` and enable it.
3.  **Create OAuth Client:** Go to `APIs & Services` → `Credentials`. Click `+ CREATE CREDENTIALS` → `OAuth 2.0 Client IDs`. Choose `Web application`.
4.  **Set Redirect URIs:**
    *   Production: `https://imgsquash.com/auth/callback`
    *   Staging: `https://staging.imgsquash.com/auth/callback`
    *   Dev: `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`
5.  **Configure Consent Screen:** Set your App Name, Support Email, and the `userinfo.email` + `userinfo.profile` scopes.
6.  **Get Credentials:**
    *   `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
    *   `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`

## 2. GitHub OAuth (4 Steps)

For the builders. This one's easy.
**Dashboard:** `https://github.com/settings/developers`

1.  **New OAuth App:** Go to GitHub Developer Settings → OAuth Apps. Click `New OAuth App`.
2.  **App Details:** Fill in your Application name, Homepage URL, and a description.
3.  **Callback URL:** Set the Authorization callback URL for production, staging, and dev.
4.  **Get Credentials:**
    *   `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`
    *   `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`

## 3. Apple Sign-In (8 Steps)

Apple's process is a broken model. You just have to push through it.
**Dashboard:** `https://developer.apple.com/account`

1.  **Create App ID:** In the Developer Console, create a new `App ID`. Description: `ImgSquash Web App`. Bundle ID: `com.imgsquash.web`.
2.  **Enable Sign In with Apple:** Find the capability and check the box.
3.  **Create Service ID:** Identifier: `com.imgsquash.web.service`.
4.  **Configure Service:** Edit the Service ID, enable "Sign in with Apple" again, and add your domain (`imgsquash.com`).
5.  **Set Return URLs:** Configure for production, staging, and dev.
6.  **Create Key:** Go to `Keys`, create one, and enable "Sign in with Apple."
7.  **Generate Private Key:** Download the `.p8` file. Don't lose it. Note your Key ID and Team ID.
8.  **Generate Client Secret:** This is a JWT you have to generate yourself.
    *   `APPLE_CLIENT_ID`
    *   `APPLE_CLIENT_SECRET`

## 4. Discord OAuth (4 Steps)

Simple. Direct. How it should be.
**Dashboard:** `https://discord.com/developers/applications`

1.  **New Application:** Create it and give it a name.
2.  **Configure OAuth2:** Go to the `OAuth2` tab and add your Redirects.
3.  **Set Scopes:** Add `bot`, `identify`, `email`, `guilds`.
4.  **Get Credentials:**
    *   `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`
    *   `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET`

## 5. Twitter OAuth 2.0 (6 Steps)

They call their developer platform a "platform." Incredible. You have to apply for access and wait.
**Dashboard:** `https://developer.twitter.com/`

1.  **Apply for Access:** You need "Elevated" access. Expect to wait.
2.  **Create App:** Once approved, create an app in the Developer Portal.
3.  **App Details:** Set your Website URL and a description.
4.  **Set Permissions:** Edit App permissions to `Read` to get email address access.
5.  **Callback URL:** Set the type to `Web App` and add your callback URL.
6.  **Get API Keys:**
    *   `TWITTER_CLIENT_ID`
    *   `TWITTER_CLIENT_SECRET`

## 6. Facebook & Instagram OAuth (Meta Platform)

Welcome to the Meta maze. One dashboard for both.
**Dashboard:** `https://developers.facebook.com/`

1.  **Create App:** `My Apps` → `Create App`. Type: `Business`.
2.  **Add Products:** Set up `Facebook Login` and `Instagram Basic Display`.
3.  **Configure Redirect URIs:** Add your callback URLs for all environments. This is required for both products.
4.  **App Review:** You must request `email` and `public_profile` for Facebook and `user_profile` for Instagram. Submit for review.
5.  **Get Credentials:**
    *   `FACEBOOK_CLIENT_ID` / `FACEBOOK_CLIENT_SECRET`
    *   `INSTAGRAM_CLIENT_ID` / `INSTAGRAM_CLIENT_SECRET`

## Other Key Platforms

These are straightforward. No excuses.

*   **TikTok:** (4 Steps) Go to the developer dashboard, create a Web App, set Redirect/Live URLs, and grab your credentials.
*   **Coinbase:** (4 Steps) Go to OAuth Applications, create a new app, set details and permissions (`wallet:accounts:read`, `wallet:user:read`), and get your keys.
