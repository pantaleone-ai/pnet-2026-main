## Development Guidelines

### Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev  # Runs on port 1408

# Build for production
npm run build
```

### Code Standards

- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled
- **ESLint**: Next.js configuration
- **Prettier**: Code formatting
- **File naming**: kebab-case for files, PascalCase for components

### Coding Guidelines

When writing code for this project, follow these principles:

**TypeScript & Documentation**

- Write type-safe TypeScript code with explicit types when necessary
- Add comments only when they clarify complex logic, function purpose, or non-obvious behavior
- Avoid obvious comments that merely restate the code
- Use descriptive variable and function names that make the code self-documenting
- Keep comments concise and focused on the "why" rather than the "what"

**Code Style**

- No emojis in code, comments, or commit messages
- Write clean, readable code that minimizes the need for extensive documentation
- Prefer self-explanatory code over commented code
- Use JSDoc for public APIs and exported functions when the signature alone isn't clear

**Best Practices**

- Follow SOLID principles and clean code practices
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use meaningful names that reveal intent
- Write code that is easy to understand at first glance
- Avoid over-commenting; let the code speak for itself

### Styling Guidelines

- Use Tailwind CSS v4 syntax
- Follow existing color scheme (zinc-based)
- Support dark/light modes
- Use CSS variables for theme colors

## Environment & Configuration

### Environment Variables

See `.env.example` for required variables:

**Core Application**:

- `APP_URL` - Application base URL (e.g., `https://hiretimsf.com`)

## Deployment

### Vercel Deployment

- Automatic deployment from GitHub
- Environment variables configured in Vercel dashboard
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Output directory: `.next`

### Build Commands

```bash
npm run build          # Production build
npm run start          # Start production server
npm run preview        # Build and preview locally
```

## Contributing

### Code Quality

- Run `npm run lint` before committing
- Use `npm run format:write` for code formatting
- Check types with `npm run check-types`
